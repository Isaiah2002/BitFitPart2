## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Again I followed Vasanth Banumurthy's video walkthrough for Unit 6.
Even though I was not able to complete Unit 5 or 6, I want to give him a big thank you because the videos were very helpful.
The explanations about Data Persistence and Fragments and Navigations were very helpful, I just couldn't translate them to code.
Just like my Unit 5 project submission Unit 6 also has a lot of errors that I could not fix.
I found that my root issue was that I could not sync my project with the dependencies in my module, so I tried to express that in my video along with the errors.
Because I could not sync my project I was unable to make any fragment files so I could not complete those parts of the project.
